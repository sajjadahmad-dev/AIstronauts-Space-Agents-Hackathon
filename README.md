# AIstronauts: Space Agents on a Mission 🚀

Welcome to **AIstronauts**, an AI-powered system designed to revolutionize space operations by automating mission planning and ground station workflows. This project combines **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to create intelligent agents for space missions.

## **Project Overview**
AIstronauts is a **Space Operations Management System** that integrates two main components:
1. **Mission Planning System**: Uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize mission plans for space operations.
2. **Ground Station RPA System**: Automates command processing and workflow execution using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

This project is built for the **AI for Connectivity Hackathon II: Building Resilient Networks** hosted by **LabLab AI**.

## **Features**
- **Mission Planning**:
  - Simulates mission environments using OpenAI Gym.
  - Trains a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent to optimize mission plans.
  - Generates mission timelines and visualizes training progress.
- **Ground Station RPA**:
  - Processes natural language commands using DistilBERT (NLP).
  - Executes predefined workflows for tasks like telemetry collection and system checks.
  - Provides real-time analytics and metrics for system performance.
- **Interactive Interface**:
  - Built using **Streamlit** for an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
  - Visualizes data using **Plotly** for mission timelines, training progress, and workflow execution.
